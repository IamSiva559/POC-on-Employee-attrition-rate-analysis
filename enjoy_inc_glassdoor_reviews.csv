When they do get questioned by the Field Managers, they say, ""This is what Ron wants"" putting it on the CEO of the company who probably has no idea this is even being asked of the field. Long work hours, expectation to be available everyday during all hours, poor weather policy despite having Experts in the field in very cheap Ford Transits. Coaches are an absolute joke there, wasting all their time on Zoom calls talking about their own lives instead of building strategy to drive business. Company acts as if they are living in the values but it's bogus. This is a cell phone store on wheels, there's no flexibility, the start up culture is dead. The senior leaders act like we are doing ""great work"" but the reality is that the business model is based on screwing people over and selling them something they probably don't need anyway. 

When the company does come up with something new, they refer to it as ""solving the puzzle"" basically a way of saying that they don't have the answers and they want YOU to come up with all of them: they won't give you credit, they won't pay you extra for those ideas. They will come to expect it of you. Lots of great leaders are starting to exit the company because they can see through the lies and deception. They only look out to help their people! They constantly get poor reviews from employees and managers.

Demanding work. You’ll be doing 6-10 at home visits a day with pressure to sell additional solutions. It’s a lot of pressure, you’ll feel it after a while. There is little to no commission on the sales, which really creates high turnover. Why work so hard unless you can be rewarded much more for your efforts elsewhere? Retention was low and in my market, and understandably, so was morale.

During my tenure, it changed from a customer service team to a sales force. It’s no easy thing to transition to - but it was done. Prepare yourself to sell add on solutions and hit your numbers. That’s all that matters in the end. No matter what will be said front-facing. It’s about conversion. If you don’t mind that there is good flexibility for work/life balance.

Experts do unethical behavior like not telling customers they are putting insurance, experts signing off on customers account without the consent of the customer, and taking off insurance from one number and putting it on another line just to make a sale and managers on condoning the behavior just to keep the numbers right. And the experts that aren’t doing shady behavior are the ones that are at risk of losing their job. Managers are just as shady as they shady experts. Job is too stressful for a job with no real promise.

A third of the company experts are on performance improvement plans, leading to potential job losses within a pandemic. Managers and higher ups have never done the job so are so far removed they don't understand the struggles.

Complaints to higher ups and ""people success"" (HR) about bullying from managers gets completely ignored. 3 of my colleagues have because of work pressure in the past month.

 45 minutes free in a 10 hour shift (they removed a 15 min break so they could get more visits and sales), sometimes you can't find anywhere to go to the toilet so experts carry bottles in the van.

If you get a sale or need help with it, EE and BT helplines are useless and leave you embarrassed in front of customers.

Targets have increased throughout lockdown, even though we should be more careful they are encouraging us to go into homes and put ourselves at risk to hit targets. This is the same company with kindness as its main value. Sad and hilarious.

Possibly a good position for someone who likes sales
Decent benefit package.  Health, dental, vision, etc.","Job is sold to job seekers as “delivery, setup, and tech support,” or like “working at an Apple store!”  After training, metrics are 100% sales based!
The expectation is to up-sell to people who’ve already purchased a new device with insurance, another new device, or other products they may not need or want.
Potentially very unsafe!  They’ve stated they will block out zip codes they’ve deemed unsafe, yet I’ve been expected to deliver to apartment complexes in neighborhoods known for violence at night while carrying thousands of dollars worth of products.
Management cares only about the sales, not what’s best for us or the customers.  They veil this as “adding value” but in training and in practice, it amounts to using misleading and loaded language to get people to sign up for things they may not want.
Mobile device insurance is pushed harder than anything, and is the biggest scam Enjoy or AT&T has.  The big selling points are supposed to be $29 screen replacement, and free battery replacement.  All batteries have a 1 year warranty anyway, and only cost $50 to $70 to replace them through official channels (at Apple).  You’d pay $180 in insurance before you’d even need to use it for a battery replacement.  The displays used under insurance are not official Apple displays, are thinner and more prone to future breaking, almost never sit correctly on the device, and many times don’t include the waterproof seal, thus compromising your device further.  They also don’t tell you that once you get your device repaired through their insurance program, it voids any remaining manufacturers warranty.  If you’re prone to breaking an Apple device, get Apple Care.  If not, go without.  Either way, avoid this “Protect Advantage.”
Some of the sales practices they teach are sketchy at best, and dishonest at worst.  As an example, if we make a change that lowers someone’s plan by $40 per month, I’ve been encouraged to tell them their new plan lowers their bill by $25 per month and includes protection (+$15 per month).  This makes it sound like the insurance is included in the plan, when in reality it’s a separate add on.  Enjoy makes money on every protection plan added to a customers account, so it’s pure profit for them.
High turnover.  Out of the 7 other people hired with me, only 3 remain, and all 3 of us are already looking for something else.  All 3 of us feel we were sold a lie when being interviewed, and none of us have a positive view of Enjoy as a whole.
Very young crowd.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as I was a manager by the age of 19, but in this company, it feels as though they’re trying to hire younger people so they can mold them into thinking this is how a company should operate.  I’m not exactly “old”, but I’ve had enough jobs in the past to know how a company like this operates.  Hire young, tell them this is the way all jobs operate, and keep them for as long as possible before they realize that’s a lie.
No real growth opportunity.  In our building, there’s effectively 3 positions: field work, 1 person in operations, and 1 manager.  The trainer, lead, and captains are all in the field as well, so even being promoted has you doing the same job as everyone else.",1,1,2,1,4,1,https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Enjoy-Technology-Reviews-E1090707.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Enjoy-Technology-RVW40708519.htm

-day is managed mostly by yourself

-you can explore your city and surrounding areas

-good amount of holidays

-good training that can be useful for yourself as well as prospective jobs

-training can be fun, and often didn’t felt like a classroom, very casual feel to it

-feedback to management is listened to

-feedback to yourself is constructive

-decent pay

-you are paid for any extra hours you do if you are back late

-manager at my EH (Enjoy House) is amazing and cares for the well-being, safety, and timely return of experts, but some managers are very heavy on sales

-work team, including captain (manager) feels more like a group of friends than colleagues, and if you ever need help or support they’re there for you.

-environment is very positive

-NPS scores keep you motivated

-very organised

-The company actually wants feedback on what they can do to make your job better, while also improving quality of service to customers.","-10 hour shifts that you often end up being back late from due to travel time (sometimes this is just bad luck due to the nature of the job)

-hardly any sick days

-was first informed that it was not a sales job, but a customer service experience, after a while “solutions” came to be our word for sales (however, a solution doesn’t necessarily mean a sale, for example BT visits: you can get a solution by trying to knock money off of the customers bill, as well as swapping packages to cheaper ones etc)
I worked in a heavy sales job in a large tech store for a while so I’m not a stranger to sales, so this doesn’t bother me.

-some management in the company have completely lost sight of the actual meaning of enjoy, and only care about sales, this can mean some experts being told to go to a visit knowing full well they will be back late, which is unfair, as experts have a life and families to return to after a 10 hour day.

-upper management will often give the excuse of “the clay is still wet” since they are a startup company, however, they have also said this while making big improvements

-consistency with training is meh, there are some trainers who are able to keep you engaged and interested, and then there are some who feel like they are just reading a script

-set unrealistic expectations when recruited, don’t believe it’s going to be this perfect dream job, it’s like any job, there’s upsides and downsides

-they will use the winning together value to try and get you to feel bad for cancelling/rescheduling a visit even if it makes you late back, don’t let them, stand your ground

-(not really a con but kinda in the middle, as it’s understandable)cancelling and rescheduling visits usually comes as a last resort, managers will offer to pay you over time if you go and attend the visit late, however I understand this as the company gets paid per visit, and if they cancel visits all the time, they will make no revenue and therefore no job.

Overall, I’m happy working here. The job is actually very easy, especially coming from a tech background. I’ve seen a lot of negative reviews on enjoy and I don’t think a lot of them are fair, and I think this is partly due to being given this image of a perfect, well oiled machine of a job where nothing can go wrong.

Their model is solely based on upselling items and promos for AT&T. Social interaction is a must to get these sales, so without it, it seems like this company is heading downhill. 


It also seems that their other partners have disbanded from them, which is a shame because I loved the Sonos and Magic Leap visits. My experience there wasn't bad but it was not helpful for my growth and it is definitely not a career. 

They promise to help you and when you show signs of progress, expectations start to become unachievable. As with my case, I struggled to sell new lines. I started getting into a groove for one week, but then didn't sell any the following week. I got a warning. At that point, I just couldn't handle the stress it gave me. I'm glad I got out when I did. I'm sure they'll recover, but be warned, you're not working for Enjoy, you're working for AT&T. 

The driving and outdated software is the worst part. You can have a visit in one part of the city and the next 1 hour away. Also, their OPUS software was severely outdated. I remember walking into a visit with a former AT&T employee and she said the OPUS software looks exactly the same as when she worked with it 7 years ago. It takes forever to get everything done.

Every morning during our daily huddles/meetings we go over the results and plans on how you will have to sell more. If you don’t enjoy sales, do NOT apply here. 

2. Your safety is not a concern of HQs. You are often sent to into customers homes in rough areas of town without any sort of background checks to make sure you aren’t in danger. Anytime you file a safety report, it’s read over but nothing is changed from it. Often you or another expert will be sent back to the same unsafe area or even same unsafe home. 

3. There are no growth opportunities! More often than not you either stay in the same position for years or a new comer is promoted within 6 months. If you’re a good seller, forget moving up in the company. They’ll want you to remain in your sales position to profit off your talents as much as they can.

- unrealistic sales quotas with NO commission 
- if you have a family emergency don’t expect a sick leave, they will make you use your PTO
- horrible management; they hire outside people with zero mobile retail experience to lead expert. Like why do I have 5 years of mobile retail experience and my captain has 0? 
- they’ll lie to your face. Orientation and interviews are glammed up to be this amazing customer focused job meant to bring a white glove service to the customer, oh excuse me enjoyer. They also heavily push you to find a way to get them to buy accessories oh wait, “solutions” and let’s not forget the insurance, wait I meant “protection” think of this from a customers perspective, as a client YOURE offer a free device set up, awesome right? But wait why is my tech guy/gal pitching me cases, screen protectors and insurance or adding lines? If someone’s capable of ordering a phone online they’re more than capable of already knowing whether or not they wanted any accessories and adding lines to their plan. Let’s be real here no one wants their amazon guy selling them extra items at their doorstep. Most enjoyers assume we’re a set up/delivery company and they love it but majority visits are turned sour and full of lies when the sales come into place. 
- they don’t care about their values the way they claim. One of their newer values is “justice” but you’re also not supposed to drop off a phone in an “unsafe” neighborhood, are lower class people not allowed to have a nice phone? Who are we to judge? And that’s not including the horrible work life balance, they’ll force you to do an early visit attempt for the next day if you’ve completed your days visits early and instead of going home early to your family like they say they want you to now you’re stuck driving 45 minutes for someone who was scheduled for tomorrow. 
- blatant favoritism, if you’re not brown nosing your captain you get 0 recognition and for a job that pushes sales with no commission a quick shout out would feel good since my efforts aren’t compensated but not even that. 
- no real room to grow. They’ll tell you they hire from within but the most you can do is lead expert or fulfillment and even those you need to have been a regular expert for 6 months and continuously hit unrealistic sales quotas plus have 10/10 customer service reviews to even be considered.
- get ready to let your health go down the drain, you’ll be eating out 4/7 days of the week and unless you can stomach chips and sandwiches every one of those days don’t expect to pack lunch. 
- breaks are COMPLETELY ILLEGAL. For a 10 hour shift we only get a 30 minute break that is heavily monitored from start to finish, I’ve been in situations where my visit is deep into the country side and the closest food is 15 minutes away but as soon as my lunch drops I have to take it, that’s 15 minutes gone, next I order the food and wait, another 5-7 gone, now I have less than 12 minutes to Scarf down all my food and hit the road again. Recently they tried to compensate that by adding 2 ten minute breaks between the days but those are pointless, in total you’re only getting 50 minutes of downtime and driving /ordering considering more like 25 minutes. At least in my state for every 4hr worked you get a 30 minute break, for every 2 hours worked you get 10 minutes so realistically we’d need at least 90-120 minute breaks for our shift and I’d rather lose the pay on that break than suffer. 
- if you’re a POC and kiss up enough you might get promoted to keep face of the company but just know higher ups are all Caucasian who’ve been hired from outside the company. I’ve met maybe 3-5 POC captains since I worked at enjoy but almost 70 Caucasian’s. 
- you’re expected to work regardless of weather, we had a hurricane warning recently and our captain said and I quote “bring an extra change of clothes just in case” why would I ever have to do that? If the conditions aren’t safe then have the decency to protect your people, this company is money hungry
- when you call out the managers or company in general of their flaws their excuse is always “were a start up” but it’s been 5 years, the least you could’ve done in that time is listen to your experts And add in commission and real room for growth in the company

The growth is there and available, however, you must be in line with company values and culture, as equally as it is essential for you to meet KPI’s.

Good bit of freedom in your day, to a limited extent.","Much of company focus has shifted away from core values over the years, due to exploitation of bad eggs, and bizarre corporate belief in not letting them go. I assume it is due to the amount of money invested in training, which also seems unnecessary to fly someone across the country to teach about core values the company no longer seems to embrace. The insurance looks good and manageable for a budget, which you will be doing if you work here and have a family, but buyer beware of the economy version of the plan. They literally cover next to nothing and have a sizable deductible, that seems to continue to grow yearly. I had an ER visit not long ago, and ended up paying 1200 dollars for something that normally would have been about 300. 

The company through training, makes you feel as though you'll be raking in money and advancing quickly with a growing company. But most higher positions are hired out instead of internal. 

Stressful to meet ever growing metrics set aside by corporate. You are only allowed 30 minutes in most visits to process, activate, and transfer customers devices, while unpacking retail case to upsell them on accessories, insurance, or any other measured metric. Then pack up and make it to the next visit that may or may not be an hour away, within a two hour window. The company keeps seemingly requiring more and more of their experts and pay raises and/or commission do not come along with the added work. 

They are 10 hour shifts, which is great for some, but on busy days you'll have to skip lunch or any break or suffer hurting your own metrics. Which is the only thing they'll fire for. You could be the worst employee with no sense of teamwork or responsibility, but if your metrics hit, they'll never fire you apparently. While good employees that do work together, but not good at sales, which was never advertised to them in taking the job, are let go quickly. 

You're probably better off taking a job with AT&T if you can get one. The part time employees I've met make more than us, and while held to a bit more scrutiny, it seems the company is sort of shortly behind in that area. It's starting to feel like we were just hired as a cheap substitute for retail employees, a way to avoid paying commission and unionization.",3,4,2,2,2,None,https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Enjoy-Technology-Reviews-E1090707.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Enjoy-Technology-RVW31242877.htm

No. Seriously, if you want an environment where having your heart on your sleeve is a big part of who you are, and you can balance it with hitting some aggressive sales goals, come on in, and get ready!

- Majority of our internally developed educational modules and app systems are high quality and has been built on years of very tough learns of generations of field Experts past. 

- Almost every member I have interacted on the HQ/Corporate level is a genuine well-meaning person, who clearly is invested in long term success of this company.

- For what the field level job requirements are (provided you are willing to push past comfort levels and honing your sales skills) the job is pretty easy considering the benefits (decent health care, stock options you can vest in a year, 4 x 10 work week w 2 hour OT in our state). We have room to grow in this aspect, but if Enjoy can have breakout viability, it can finally help snap the business world out of their ""gig economy"" nightmare march and business can scale in a more human focused way.  

- Did I mention the people? Our talent brass is intense for what we spend a majority of our time doing, and that's ok as long as there is a clear career path. 

- Can't speak to our UK and Toronto markets, but it is cool that we are fulfilling this niche internationally. Don't know how different the partner experiences there are.","- Let's get the big elephant out of the room first: AT&T. 
   
    -Now, I have actually come to respect and admire AT&T as a business over time despite the LITANY of issues interfacing with this company as a third party contractor creates. I can't imagine this being a common perspective, but with that said I signed up to work for ENJOY, a start-up spearheaded by an OG retail visionary with the promise of bringing that high touch retail experience to peoples homes. Not showing up at the door as ""The AT&T guy"" even though I had to sign a lengthy contract BY AT&T saying I will get sued if I refer to myself as such. 

     - We literally have the guy who was the creative head for designing the Pixar logo as a co founder, and his team's branding basically re-shaped the Apple Logo for the 21st century, but we are dependant on some Yahoo in Dallas who is mashing a bunch of ""Omni-Sales-Channel"" pipelines together and calling each one ""Ready To Go (sm)"" with a different sub tagline differntiating each. If you just read this and are asking ""WTF did I just read""... basically, our company, who has one of the most iconic brand designers in the world, has to take marketing advice from the team that thought switching Direct Tv Now to ATT TV Now is going to solve their customer retention problem.  

    -- On top of the branding miss, and our aggressive sales goals in all the reviews, we are being held liable for a HUGE inventory and supply chain mistake AT&T has made recently. We just had a MASSIVE hiring wave anticipating our rising volume and demand and right now we literally don't have the prime inventory that normally leads to profitable visits and solution attachments. This means we have less visits and we have to be performing at 3X capacity to be considered profitable as an expert long term.   I genuinely was hoping with everything we have learned with this new wave we would be putting up some groundbreaking numbers, but we literally don't have the inventory on shelves, to develop the new hires with the optimum pace and practice, meaning if this doesn't change fast we will have a hard time retaining our headcount. I legit want to be wrong about this long term, and hope the heads on top recognize this and rectify this so we can actually be judged on our (still tough but fair) metrics not the fact that we are going through weeks wasted resources because someone left a zero in a spreadsheet. 

- It is being worked on, but 401k matching is currently not available. 

- SONOS is pretty cool partner, but we barely get them, other than that there are no current major partners in the U.S nationwide. We had a Google partnership pilot, but it's looking pretty mum on whether it is rolled out as intended.

- The role and expectations have changed at a breakneck pace due to all the pivots Enjoy has had to do since its inception, it created a big rift and some resentments that stuck for a few iterations in markets. We are getting right back to balance, but my fear is with above-mentioned partner and the hot seat they are on with their Board of Investors (check the news!), if we can grow and thrive should anything happens to them or our partnership.

- Recruiting has this odd tendency to panic hire managers externally, and it has lead to some very mixed results. Nothing against getting the right person for the job, but it limits growth on the ground level, and some managers ended up being a terrible fit for their role, and haven't inspired much confidence during their tenure. If the people under your watch are legitimately not sure what you do  all day, then they are too busy not doing their job right to be asking those questions and that's on you. 

-This also includes former experts who got promoted when the job metric involved being on time and knowing how to give a great high five. We trying to port our customer's moms phone number from Verizon now in order to hit those sales metrics, AND give that perfect high five. Some have legitimately grown with the demands of the job, others have gone AWOL in the process.

Genuinely friendly higher-ups.","Increased pressure to hit numbers despite being told that’s not what the role is about. Lures new hires in with promise of work life balance and being able to set your schedule. But often schedules that are picked by you are ignored by the system. It was not uncommon to have to request schedule changes.

Also, despite being well-loved by customers for being an archetype for what a customer service representative should be, Experts are told they need to add on services and accessories in order to boost per visit revenue despite being trained to listen to the customer needs carefully and be respectful of their wishes…
So the Expert effectively becomes an overly polite aftermarket salesperson who, if not having added insurance to enough mobile phone plans that month or not having added enough additional lines to people’s phone plans that month, you get the axe despite customers loving you and leaving glowing reviews of how terrific the service is and how great the person was who was in their home.

It’s a hilariously dangerous line to walk between being respectful, listening to needs and acting accurately to meet those needs without pushing a sales agenda on a customer who has already made their purchase and has (in this day and age) budgeted explicitly for just the products and services the expert has been scheduled to bring them.

I felt that if I wasn’t pushy enough, I didn’t get the numbers. I witnessed some other employees misreporting ‘points’ (used to quantify certain actions taken or services performed in visits with customers. It is a way to generate data on the visit) in order to inflate their numbers by days end and report above target for the day. I would not do this and I ultimately led to me dismissal and a few others in following weeks. All those were well-loved by customers and had glowing records of above and beyond service.

But as is the case with every company in growth mode, the needs of the one, outweigh the needs of the many and people who were deemed paragons of customer service six months ago, are asked to leave when they’re not pushy enough to drive up add-on sales.

Also, raises stopped coming even though we were increasing numbers. Rather than raises to match  increased cost of living, we were offered ‘swag’ as prizes for doing our job well. A game-like system was created as a competition in order to drive sales. Yay for friendly intra-office rivalry! It turned out those numbers were being used to grade us for review time. We would ‘win’ stuff for putting up the best numbers one month. It was like going from being able to buy groceries to being able to carry your belongings in a cheap nylon tote that advertised the company. After getting stuff like that rather than a cost of living raise (not in over a year) I stopped proselytizing for them out of genuine enthusiasm for what they do and let the cheap bag and stickers advertise for them without me having to spend the energy.

That’s what working for them did for me in the long run. That’s THE  negative. They bring people in who display an over abundance of people skills and empathy.

A lot of the negative reviews you’ll read here are from current or former experts. They are, for the most part, exceedingly accurate. You will be hired under the guise of improving lives, changing retail, and providing personalized customer service experiences. The company does want you to be a part of those things. But they will also hold you to very strict and often unattainable sales goals. Those goals will increase frequently (often monthly, definitely quarterly), so that just as you feel you’re approaching success, you’ll be back in failing territory. Your ability to sell items and services will be tallied in a point system and you will be ranked against other employees. These “points” tell nothing about the quality of the experience you provide, but simply how good you are at up-selling to customers who, for the most part, have no idea what they’re signing up for when they choose Enjoy.

Here are a few of the other major issues with the Expert role:
-	Experts are held to an unattainable “completion” rate – 10 visits in a 10-hour day. The absurd routing software they use, and the ridiculously large territories experts must cover make it impossible for them to complete 10 visits in a 10 hour day. For example, from 2pm-5pm, experts are expected to complete 3 visits. Those visits are expected to take 20-30 minutes, could be up to 2 hours from each other, and they’re also expected to take a 30-minute lunch.

-	Most visits are for AT&T customers. 95% of these customers did not knowingly choose Enjoy’s service; they thought they were choosing a regular delivery service. So, when an expert shows up, or calls, or texts, many customers are confused or upset. They do not want to have to sit down with a representative and present identification to receive their phone. And they especially don’t want to be up-sold. You wouldn’t either if you were expecting FedEx to drop your new phone on your doorstep.

-	Training is abysmal. The L&D team is great at training, but completely out of touch with the needs of the field. The majority of the expert role involves dealing with AT&T’s antiquated systems, and yet there is almost ZERO training on said system. Worse, in my eyes, is the complete lack of basic sales training. This is a huge opportunity given the focus on sales in the expert role. 

As a leader of a team of experts, it was my responsibility to communicate these, and other, issues to upper management and HQ partners. There were many barriers to my team’s success, as detailed above. Unfortunately, the company wasn’t interested in my opinion because I did not lead one of the top-selling teams, as dictated by the points tallied.
There are systems-based issues that prevent experts from being able to succeed in their jobs. Instead of HQ partnering with the field to improve these issues, or tempering expectations based on the roadblocks that affect teams differently, they placed 100% of the blame on the field team. The solution was “performance management.” Essentially, leaders were told that they would need to systematically fire everyone on their teams who weren’t hitting sales numbers. The overwhelming assumption was that these experts were just not trying, or simply didn’t care. In many cases, this was not true, and leaders were being told to fire high-potential employees who could not succeed under the constraints that were placed upon them. Experts started quitting in droves under the increased pressure. We could not backfill their roles given the low pay and lack of commission the company offered. When Ron was questioned about exit interview feedback from all of these experts who were quitting or being fired under the increased sales pressure, he said they were “not a right fit” for the company, seemingly uninterested in hearing feedback from ex-employees who didn’t sell enough.

Ron is, simply put, an egomaniac. He is not interested in feedback; he is interested in talking about himself and how great his company and ideas are to anyone who will listen. He does not have time for those who disagree with him. In my opinion, he is doing at Enjoy exactly what he did at JCPenney. He’s single-minded, not taking feedback from important stakeholders, and driving forward without a care for employees. And while we’re talking about Ron, please know he’s made some questionable statements about and towards women.",2,None,5,5,5,None,https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Enjoy-Technology-Reviews-E1090707.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Enjoy-Technology-RVW28056509.htm

They also drop randomly at any time throughout the day, so you never know what you have next. Oh and not only that you have 2 visits in each window, which are 2 hour windows.

Many employees are actually ex-Apple employees or poached from Apple stores. Ron Johnson is formerly the Retail Executive of Apple and has attracted the cult following of said workforce. This implies and is executed in their cult-ish facade and the decimation of their work ""culture."" You're value as an employee is reduced to ""attachment rates"" which is accessory sales added on to each visit. Which they will emphasize that sales is NOT the job, but the only KPI that matters if you want a raise or promotion. 

Compensation varies from Abhorent - to fair - to absurdly unfair. Expect your co-workers to receive anywhere from 30% below or above your own wage. For example, we had someone paid $14/hr and another $23/hr (I was in between) for doing the exact same job.  Management, or HR, will express that they are working on compensation adjustments to make it more fair but have yet to do so. Dampen your expectations if you intend to work here, there is no growth. 

You're work-life balance will eradicate from existence. 10hr work days are a minimum. All factors that vary are how far you have to travel from the office: If you have a 10am-8pm day and your last scheduled visit is at 7pm, you are expected to finish in 30 minutes which most likely not happen. If it is an hour away (which happens a lot), you will not return to the office until closer to 9pm or even after, which will be proceeded by side work or inventory counting before you are actually done with your day. Expect to be home around 9:30pm - 10pm in this example. Even if you have a 4 day work week, this workflow gets old very quickly. Oh by the way, you will struggle to find time for a lunch.

A few home truths from my first-hand experience: 
•	Enjoy Technology is not a Technology company but a ‘bespoke’ courier service. They do not develop, create or patent technology. They are a bit like the Uber of delivering  electronics or installations. 
•	You are told by the recruitment team “it’s not a sales job” when in fact it is a sales job and you'r signed  unrealistic KPIs.  
•	You have little or no time for lunch when you're out on the road and it can be a lonely place. 
•	Experts are over worked to meet 3rd party demands by BT and EE. 
•	I've never finished on time and I've been expected to be back on site 5 hours later.  
•	Security really needs to be tighten. There is a fear of  being robed and even burglaries.
 •	Enjoy is not a start up anymore, stop staying that your are. 
 •    There is an  ‘efficiency campaign’ led by HR causing chaos among the Experts.
•	The management abused their authority and status. Some also have power trip competitions  among  each other ; embarrassing.  
•	It is frown upon if you challenge your leaders and there is a sense of; 'you should know your place' and 'stay in your lane'. Otherwise you will be labelled a 'trouble maker' or seen as  ‘un-collaborative’, or even ‘frustrated’ and  ‘resilient'.  This will lead to a ‘you can’t sit with us’ attitude and you will be managed out.
•	There is no real progression unless you're very close with your Captain.  There is definitely  a ‘favoritism’ culture for those that have previously worked together at Apple.
•	There is a lots of resentment from those that do question the system and get knocked back.  
•	The turnover on the People Success and Recruitment team is high. 5 people left over 6 months.  And the support team have lost 5 people in the past 6 weeks. They can't all be wrong.

Enjoy goes out of its way to hire the nicest, most lovely people.","I’ll start with the little things and work up to the bigger things. Say goodbye to your evenings, you will work at least 10 hour days, and that’s when everything goes well. Drive times, issues with AT&Ts insanely issue prone system, customers who refuse to let you leave until they get everything they want taken care of, a scheduling system that often times makes you work 8 days in a row, trying to cram a lunch into an already insanely busy day...these are all relatively minor cons. The biggest issue is one you will see throughout these reviews...the company positions itself as an experience based company but has gradually turned into a sales based company. You can have amazing experiences with people and completely change their lives, but if you don’t manage to tack on insurance or convince them to add a line (which we’re told to misleadingly position as a free phone) then the experience didn’t really matter. The company seems to have lost more partners than they’ve gained with the primary partnership being AT&T. It’s clear AT&T doesn’t care about the experience so much as the fact that they can pay Enjoy regular delivery service prices while reaping the benefits of having a fleet team of people who will do everything an AT&T associate will do and more but without the cost and commission. Where it once seemed that the experience was what Enjoy was selling to our partners, it’s clear that either we undersold the experience aspect or maybe just that AT&T doesn’t care (in which case I’d argue that maybe they’re the wrong partners for this company). Speaking of partnerships, expect 99% of your visits to be AT&T and maybe 1% SONOS.  It’s clear AT&T is our biggest partner and where the most money comes from but as AT&T becomes our primary focus, all of the cons of AT&T come with it. We are expected to push incredibly expensive accessories, additional phones, and insurance plans to people who have already been up-sold by an AT&T rep or online. More often than not I’ve actually taken insurance off of people’s accounts because an AT&T rep has added it on without a customer knowing. As we lean harder into metrics and sales, we inch closer and closer into becoming just as bad as those associates. I’ve seen other experts lie about how much time customers have to add insurance on, add insurance on without permission, tell customers to add a line and cancel an old line to take advantage of BOGO deals, take insurance off and re-add it to get the credit, and several other shady things. Ethics, integrity and overall the customer experience goes out the window as it becomes all about money. That said it’s hard to blame people when they are threatened with termination because they’re not hitting goals. Speaking of goals and metrics, they change constantly. When the company first started metrics were basically the visits themselves, accessories, and maybe added lines. Now the experience hardly means anything, accessories are measly when it comes to revenue, and you better pray the majority of your customers aren’t already enrolled in a multiple device insurance plan.  Most of the higher ups who started as experts never had to deal with these metrics and even if you excel in one area, if it doesn’t generate enough revenue you may end up out of a job. So much of it is luck. Some days you get someone who is severely overpaying for insurance and signing them up for a multi device plan actually saves them money. Other days you are solely dropping off devices, dealing with authorized users who don’t want to buy things for someone else’s phone, or people who have every possible sales opportunity taken care of already. It’s hard to hit consistent numbers when nothing about what we do or who we see is consistent.

281,7-Nov-19,Former Employee,Fullfilment,None,,"""Literally the worst decision you could make""","If you work at HQ, it is likely that you will NEVER have to pay for lunch. 

 You get to eat your catered meal and watch the field teams bust through dangerous visits and laugh at the silly experts who do the work.  If you work in Palo Alto, you get to enjoy the luxurious, brand new corporate office with the tables crafted by the head of field’s spouse (which apparently we paid for with our new investment partners money). You can stare in wonder at your beautiful surroundings while the field teams drive around trying to find a safe place to use the bathroom.  

There is literally zero accountability for HQ teams, so feel free to do absolutely nothing! Like, literally nothing!  And don’t worry about finding time to connect with those silly experts in the field (gross right?).

If you work in the field, you will have the ability to have your mental health strengthened by sheer force of will.  Gradual exposure therapy will make you unafraid of going to unsafe and dangerous locations.  You will have the resilience of a super hero!  When dangerous or unsafe (actually life-threatening) situations happen, you will get to experience gaslighting about how it’s essentially your fault!  

You will also get to understand and grow from the amazing stress of worrying every single day that you will be fired if you don’t attach certain additional services your customers accounts.  You will receive all the training in the world on how to bend your ethical will to make questionable decisions and...pretty much lie to your customers.   

You will learn about values like Kindness:  Kindness means “don’t speak up about things that aren’t working or you will be branded a trouble maker” 

Winning Together:  Winning Together means, all of the field teams do all of the work while HQ and leadership teams (coaches) fly around to have conferences and travel on the company dime.  Winning together means by all means necessary DO NOT ever contact the head of field, because nothing is more annoying than wanting to feel like you contribute and are valued.  

Experience Obsessed: This one means, get so paranoid of losing your “experience” job that you have to decide between sacrificing your personal ethics (doing shady things) or not being with the company.   

Growth Mindset:  You get to learn how to adapt to constant change, unsupported by rational decision making.  It’s great.  Let’s just try something new because I’m a project manager!  But, yeah....no I’m not getting in a car and watching you do visits. 

But if you really want a sweet gig, seek out a position in “People Success” (HR).  You will be constantly thrilled investigating all of the craziness that happens at this company.  You also won’t have to actually...you know...work.","I didn’t believe this at first, but I feel that it’s important to acknowledge that the positive reviews you see here are the result of: 

-Email blasting people who are brand new and drinking the “fruit punch” about posting a review.  This is a disingenuous and unethical way to boost ratings.  
-Recruiting Teams literally pumping fake reviews because it is getting harder to find talent that isn’t scared off. 
-Captains boosting their ego by posting fake reviews, or to bump down specific reviews about a market.  

This company shifted hard in the last year to juice profit out of its front-line employees and in the process termed through about 40-50% of it’s expert staff.  This originates from the passive-aggressive and deceitful tactics employed by the top field leadership.  If you want to be successful at this company, leave and go work for Lululemon and make buddies that will pull you in.   That is apparently all it takes.  

It’s literally all about money.  That’s it.  Nothing else matters to this company because it has so fundamentally lost its vision in search of making business decisions simply to avoid going bankrupt.  A recent example is the mass (quick) hiring of front-line employees, only to find out that we made these calls with no data and forecasting and on the whim of our biggest partner.  

Fast forward, and now the field (front line) is scrambling to get visits and is actively looking to fire through its expert teams to get back to a sane staffing level.  Fun fact: This probably isn’t possible and the company is bleeding cash.   

It’s not healthy or sustainable to work here, and it will tax you unless you are one of the original 15-or-so employees that were originally hired.  

The core issue that you need to know about working for this company however is that it is a dangerous job.  There have been multiple, violent criminal robberies of team members.  When I had my personally property stolen because a vehicle was broken into, I was told it was my fault for having my property with me.  The job is literally you going out in a company vehicle.

Good Co-Workers","If you aren't happy you better fake it.

Captains demand happiness. They don't care if you just lost a loved one or going through a serious traumatic event... if you aren't happy they will watch you like a hawk and threaten to fire you if you don't change your attitude. 

If your performance numbers aren't up to par they will threaten to fire you but give you no opportunity to learn from others and improve.

Leaders sit all day looking at your ""performance"" and writing on Slack... other than the occasional ride along do they ever really ""work""

No forward growth in company unless you are a captains favorite.

AT&T is your main client... which would be fine if they paid you less than AT&T employees hourly AND don't give you compensation for the same sales AT&T employees are expected to.

They don't care about safety.

My manager ignored my calls when I was in a unsafe visit... when they finally called me back it was 7 hours later and they were asking if I could take a visit an hour and a half away from where I was (never once asking if I was ok from the morning event)

You are expected to take a 30 min lunch and complete 8-10 visits a day while driving anywhere from 10 mins to 2 hours away to your next visit and spend AT-LEAST 30 mins with each customer. (Ya its not possible)

Change happens frequently. It is a start up so it is understandable... but leadership insists that a cookie cutter approach for the WHOLE company is what is best and refuses to make adjustments based on what market you are in. (having worked in two markets for enjoy I will tell you the differences ARE HUGE)

If you are a top performer you can get away with anything like ILLEGALLY SIGNING a contract for a customer.

Same top performer bragged in our morning meeting about how he ""tricks"" customers into signing up for insurance or added lines and the captains applauded him.

Threatened to get fired when asked if I could apply for a opening in the fulfillment department... THAT THEY SAID WE COULD APPLY FOR IN AN EMAIL!!!!!!!!!!!

Ron Johnson (the CEO) spends more time emailing his employees about great visits they preform (which is cool at first) but the more you work their you start thinking... shouldn't he be getting us new partners?

It is an AT&T sales job and not until recently did they start telling people in interviews it is about sales.

If there is a problem you address leadership basically says to change you attitude and get over it.

*You'll get SOME time off.
*You'll probably Enjoy the surface of the culture.
*You'll also probably be intelligent enough to notice that they use the culture like a tool to paint and drive the narrative on who is causing these issues. (Seems like a PRO to be able to recognize psychological manipulation tactics and get away from them)
*Challenges your mental fortitude
*You can get ahead with the company.
*It's different depending on what market you are in.

(This would be understandable if there were more than 8 people in my warehouse.)
*Sick Time and Vacation Time are accrued in the same bank through a loophole in New York's system, so after you've worked full-time for 6 months, you'll have about 4 days of sick/vacation time. If you do happen to get sick, you do not get a separate bank for vacation. Unlike Apple, which had separate banks, you pretty much choose between being sick, or having vacation time. You also must use your time, so there's not a way to avoid utilizing this if you are sick. This is a pretty huge CON in my opinion, because you'll always be chasing time off, and life happens. It forces a presenteeism culture (working while sick) for those of us who are not fortunate enough to have unlimited PTO (Paid Time Off) offered to supervisors & managers, who seem to work from home 2-3 days out of 5 days per week anyway. (This already paints the culture as an US vs. THEM style of management.) 
*By using unclear directions, misdirection, or simply not communicating. (Utilizing this style of management, I assume, allows the supervisor a more ""hands off"" approach. If the manager is not present, the responsibility essentially does not fall on them. Absenteeism style of managing. Not effective.)
*Not always in a manner that's appropriate. Promotions are typically handed to people who elect to uproot their lives (move to new markets). A lot of the Lead positions are not posted on the Careers portion of the website, and these people are selected behind closed doors, without giving anyone a chance to interview for the positions, making me question the promotion legalities, considering you'll sign an Equal Opportunity Form upon being hired.
*I'm sure there are some great markets to work in. My feedback is specifically for the New York market. Though this company seems to be a nightmare for those in sales, working in fulfillment is only a means to an end unless you utilize the culture science to your advantage. (For some, it's not worth it to lose the genuinity of being yourself.)
*Using the culture science can be a PRO if you're doing it correctly. It's also possible for this science to be used negatively (against you), as it holds a considerable amount of power, and requires you to be a bit fabricated. Supervisors utilizing this type of behavior seem to do it for the sole purposes of information extraction. It's quite noticeable, but fascinating. 
*But bring silverware or a water bottle. I don't believe they really know how to spend money as a company. They decided to stop buying us paper cups after Christmas, so the irony wasn't lost on me that the wine rack and fridges out in Menlo Park were fully stocked. This seemed a little more NY specific. Not sure what happens to the funds the supervisors save the company by not ordering things for the employees, but maybe an audit should be in place for that specific location. 
*Schedule Unfairness/Impartiality (If you weren't)
* On a much smaller scale. Ron knew JC Penny wasn't working out, so he pretty much rocked it until he got fired. He lost them $766M, and the stock dropped 57%. He straight up screwed one of the oldest retail chains in America with untested and sweeping policy changes, and walked away with more in severance than I could make in 5 years of hard work with Enjoy. So, like our fearless leader, I think many are opting for the low road and purposely seeking termination for poor sales performance.

My time at Enjoy was a whirlwind of changes, while the promise of a 40 hour work week in 4 days, setting my own schedule and the freedom to be outside of a retail environment were so appealing, I quickly burned out with the logistical, operational and overall company issues at Enjoy.

While the partnerships with different vendors seem cool, you will barely get any training outside of AT&T's rigorous and faulty software, this is due to their contract going into effect the 2nd Q which is forcing MGMT to push sales on employees, though upon accepting their offer it was never clear that this would be a high pressure sales job with unrealistic margins.

Furthermore, while I did enjoy (lol) working with a lot of my team mates, the same cannot be said for MGMT. Upwards mobility is only guaranteed to those that are selling on market or who have a personal relationship with management, often times we saw people who were charismatic, embodied the essence of Enjoy and excelled at their role, overlooked for higher paid positions due to favoritism from managers, which is a shame. The work day is grueling, from no lunch break, though its a self made schedule you will virtually be left without time for taking care of yourself due to the distance between visits, errors during visit due to OPUS crashing and of course the anxiety and worry of trying to meet the metrics by which your job relies on. Corporate is aware of the issues that go on in each market, but reluctant to make changes that favor their team, as previously stated because of AT&T's heavy pockets weighing in operations.

Frankly, it's so sad to see the vision this company began with be flushed due to Ron's inability to pace growth and of course stop being so greedy. 

I would advice that you look for an offer elsewhere, the hiring process isn't hard and onboarding is tedious and repetitive, but if you've never traveled anywhere this may seem like a cute thing for you. The benefits or cons do not offset the fact that you're constantly stressed, pressured to sell things that customers do NOT want or need, pressured to push add-a-lines and devices people don't want.

327,24-Jun-19,Former Employee,Expert,"Nashville, TN",SE,"""So many cons""","They do go out of their way to hire good people. I got along with most of my co-workers and had little complaints. The training was fun and they expense a lot, but it was very long. Most of your day will consist of listening to music or podcast because of the long drive times. The amount of money you will make in overtime is nice.","There were so many. I am not someone that writes reviews but I had such a bad experience I felt like I had to share. They target people who have customer service and retail experience by saying it’s not a sales job, all you have to do is help people, and it’s a “startup” so there are opportunities to grow. None of this is true. 
When you are hired they fly you out of state for onboarding (I think just for new markets). Onboarding is just an entire month of ice breakers with co-works you will barely ever see because of scheduling and the fact that your alone in a car all day. As well as PowerPoints about products, company policies, and the AT&T system that you will have to use every day. The training on what you will be doing every day is next to none. You will barely get to use the AT&T system you have to use to do your job. This thing will crash at least once a week and you can’t give someone the phone they already ordered while you are in their home if that happens. And they don’t tell you how to go about that in onboarding.
Once training is done you’re on your own. You have to meet high sales goal expectations with no training on how to do so. If you don’t meet your goals you are put in a probation month. If you make it past that you're given another two weeks to get an add a line and significantly increase your overall sale (that’s as far as I got before I happily accepted a different job). If you can’t do that you are let go. 
They say you will have free time in your day, but that’s another lie. It’s a ten plus hour day of nonstop work. There were many days I skipped lunch because I had way too much to do and 10 hours wasn’t even enuff to complete it. The drive times are insane and not realistic. You will have “visits” two hours away from each other and still be expected to complete them in a three-hour time block. And after you have clocked out you have to wake up and do it all again the next day. Having three days off a week is nice, but it is only to make up for the fact that your days are so long that if you only had two days off a week you would be exhausted. If you enjoy doing anything after work like happy hour, going to games, the gym or any other activity you won't be able to do it. There is no work-life balance. 
I could say so much more. Such as the safety concerns of going into strangers houses, or almost no zip code restrictions to prevent you from ending up in a high crime area. Or the fact that hardly any of the customers want you there, or are unaware that you will be coming into their home trying to sell them items that they probably already got on Amazon.

-4 / 10 hour days 
-Sonos is great
-Comfy uniforms","-Sitting in the car/traffic for 5-6 hours a day
-Unreasonable expectations developed by people who have never been an expert OR ever ridden along in the car with an Expert to see how the day to day is
-Expanded much too quickly to appease ATT instead of fixing the glaring flaws of the role to make sure Experts were set up for success
-Most management is extremely inexperienced and disconnected from their market. Adding on to above point, Field Leaders never ride along to see what is happening in their own markets to address struggles of the role.
-Hitched horse to the wrong wagon in ATT. Sending Experts out on the front lines to correct and remedy numerous lies and falsehoods in orders for people who were not expecting to be adding lines. ATT reps would constantly place these orders to hit their quotas. Usually taking advantage of older people and people with language barriers. 
-Always adding new solutions and sales metrics to again, appease ATT, which all takes time in a visit, without ever accounting for this time and changing the visit duration over the past 1.5 years.
-Visits dropped in throughout the day can be up to an hour and twenty-five minutes away from your current visit that you are in, in the same two-hour window. Do the math. This was a completely normal occurrence.
-Growth opportunities are non-existent unless you want to follow ONE path. That path would be to manage the market you are in and try to put a positive spin on the Expert role without any positive improvements to the role.  
-Metrics are fine, the company needs to grow and be profitable. I always understood that. Make the metrics obtainable and if the entire company is much below the metric, DO NOT raise the target the next quarter.  Reassess how you're measuring the target and set it accordingly so that it is achievable.
-Recently there have been very questionable performance plans developed with ZERO clarity to the Experts on these plans on what improvement looks like. Transparency is a must.
-Feedback given from consistently top performing experts about how to improve the role is met with objection and defensiveness from market managers. Horrible way for leadership to act in a company that values Growth Mindset
-Numerous errors when processing an order. Yes, the internal Enjoy support team is fantastic but the amount of time it takes to fix the error and figure out the workaround takes more time and puts you even more behind than you already were to the scheduling program.
-Visit scheduling system is atrocious and daily makes for unrealistic drive times. Often to make visits, you needed to drive through your ""lunch"" to get ahead. Can drop visits in that will begin at 7PM up to a few miles from your Warehouse. If you ever come back late (after 8PM) you will be reprimanded.... So either miss a visit that should have never dropped into your schedule in the first place and have it count against one or your metrics OR come back late to the Office and be hassled for coming back after 8PM. Too many Catch 22s!
-It had gotten a bit better but the order flow through ATT website is extremely lacking in giving customers the information needed for a successful experience.  Still far too often they have no idea who Enjoy is or that they need to be present.
-Hold Experts to meeting their metrics even though the metrics are constantly inaccurate due to errors when tracking achievements.",1,2,2,2,1,None,https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Enjoy-Technology-Reviews-E1090707.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Enjoy-Technology-RVW27284980.htm

Their fleet vehicles are dangerous. They’ve smoked before because of lack of maintenance. Also, all their bins and inventory is barely anchored in the backseat. If you get in a wreck, it will be the inventory that kills/hurts you. 

They advertise the field positions as amazing career opportunities, and put up a big show by flying you to a cool place for on on-boarding; but then after the first couple weeks, you are no longer value you. They are okay just firing people now who don’t meet their unrealistic standards. 

I have worked in sales for many years, and frankly, their metrics are quite unrealistic to maintain with the tools the employees are given, or should I say, lack of tools.

- Teammates can be great to commiserate with
- Meet some interesting customers. Have great conversations about things other than iPhone cases. I made several friends out of customers and still keep in touch with a few","Company doesn't care about employees' health. Our mobile inventory van was an operations disaster that was loathed by every member of the team I spoke to, plenty of whom—including myself—expressed these feelings to management. When the van got in a wreck, sending my coworker to the hospital with a cut hand, the van went out of commission for less than a week before they sent it back out for a new product launch. Our complaints—and my coworker's injury—seem to have fallen on deaf ears.

Compliance issues with partners were ignored when convenient. One captain transported Magic Leap product in his personal vehicle, a violation of our contract with that company.

I started as a problem solver who helped people integrate technology into their lives. I ended up as a door-to-door phone case salesman who earned no commission. Instead of solving people's problems, I was trained to create problems that people didn't know they had: ""You sure your baby doesn't need an iPhone X? What about a DirecTV? Please?"" I often felt more like a used-car salesman than like an ""expert.""

I was consistently earning 5/5 star reviews from my customers, but was threatened with termination if I didn't attach enough add-a-lines, accessories, etc. It was a numbers game, not a people game. By the end of my employment, the expectation was that we were adding accessories (like a $40 screen protector) in 50% of visits.

The way I see it, we were hired because we deeply care about making people happy by solving their problems. That people-pleasing mentality was then exploited to drive sales.

Absolutely NO room for growth. Training almost never involved new technology. Rather, it involved motivational speeches to up-sell to Enjoyers more frequently. I'm leaving Enjoy off my résumé because I have nothing to show for my time there.

No raises. Whatever you accept in your offer is what you're gonna get. I was there for a year and never received a raise despite performance improvements and meeting goals set by management. In fact, I never heard of anyone receiving a raise except through promotion.

Attaching add-a-lines and accessories is key to the company's profitability, but that was not made clear to Experts till 4 months after I had joined. 

I was hired with the expectation that Experts reduce return rates on partners' products and give customers the warmest delivery experience possible. Instead, the job became about numbers and ""winning together,"" which essentially meant keeping the company afloat by attaching AT&T accessories and services to orders with no incentive structure. I'd have been more motivated selling Cutco knives.

Experts' freedoms were routinely removed without proper notice or explanation. For example, we were forced to move from 5 to 10 hour shifts with less than 2 weeks notice. 

Our Manhattan headquarters was moved to Brooklyn with one month's notice.  This doubled my commute from 30 minutes to 1 hour. The company was still renting the Manhattan location, but we couldn't have our Morning Huddles there, for some reason.

Morning Huddles were a waste of time: essentially a sales pep talk that only served to dampen morale by reminding us how sales-oriented our jobs had become.

The uniform is starting to include pants. It's 95 degrees in New York today.  115° in the 34th St.  Herald Square station. Pants are downright laughable.

393,21-May-18,Current Employee,Field Expert,"San Francisco, CA",W,"""Enjoy Field Expert Perspective""","Independence, self paced, 4/10 work week with decent benefits at low premiums. Being part of a pioneering company bringing the best of the retail experience into the home delivery segment in a world of online shoppers.

On busy days, your time is spent driving a fleet vehicle and bringing technology products (like iphones and Sonos speakers) to people and setting them up. It's a really great gig for those of us who like to meet people. You may do up to 9 or 10 visits per day, but many days consists of only 5 or so visits.

You may have lots of down time, which means if you are near your home you can go home and take a long lunch, save money that way. Generally you are encouraged to return to your ""Enjoy House"" where you can brush up on new products and earn product ""badges"" so you are qualified to deliver product to people.

Field Experts work out of an ""Enjoy House"" which is basically a warehouse where stock is kept and then loaded into vehicles. Fulfillment Experts manage the inventory and load the vehicles with a min/max product level, while Field Experts are responsible to make sure they have appropriate inventory for the orders that day. Field Experts also maintain the fleet vehicles, filling with gas, getting oil changes and keeping them clean.

The structure on the expert side of things is very retail in practice. Captains run the EH's, they are basically store managers and Field Experts work under them. Coaches are akin to regional or district managers responsible for areas of the country that may cover several states. Captains report into Coaches. 

The company is expanding and loves to promote from within, so there is certainly  some room for advancement.

People at this company tend to be very nice and like-minded, sharing a common goal to have really great visits with ""enjoyers"" (customers.) You are definitely a people person if you work this job.","There is lots and lots of driving, which means sitting behind the wheel hours on end.  If you do not enjoy driving or worse are not very good at it, especially in a city, then this isn't the job for you. Some markets, like Manhattan have commuter field experts who take public transportation, but most of us drive and drive and drive.

The pay is on the top end of ""retail"" workers, most are getting 16 - 17/hr in the Bay Area but don't expect any raises and there is no commission. The company uses a ""points"" system to evaluate the effectiveness of field experts. They make a game of it, pitting markets against each other in order to foster a competitive, but fun environment.

Like most systems, some experts have found a way to game the system and achieve high points scores by having mostly ""premium"" visits assigned and doing low point ""express"" or follow up ""enjoy""  visits off the books, or having some scheduled problem visits (customer not returning calls or not home) shifted to another Expert so as not to lower their over-all point average.

There are definitely safety concerns, especially for those who work in traditionally troubled areas. Fraud orders are common and experts have to use good judgement to understand if something is fraud and perhaps dangerous and then escalate when required.

And like any job dealing with the public, you meet really nice people and also some really nasty people. Except in this case you are going into their home or work place and it can get very uncomfortable really quick. I've been to some homes where is it filthy and gross and uncomfortable - but then there are really good visits with nice people who genuinely really appreciate the special in home service they are getting.

The Enjoy Houses (the place where you go everyday to load up your vehicle) are nice, but lack that start up feel. They are woefully under stocked on snack and refreshments, while the Head Quarters in Menlo Park (near FaceBook) have regular catered lunches, full snacks and valet parking. The company can definitely do better to make the Enjoy Houses more enjoyable and encourage Field Experts to return instead of going home or going to the mall when they have down time. Some recreational areas, better food and drinks, catered lunches every once and a while would go a long way to foster a more cohesive and comfortable work space,

Experts are where the rubber meets the road - they are the product of the company, but at the same time you definitely feel you are on the bottom rung of the ladder. There appears to be NO BUDGET for anything fun in terms of catered lunches, off site team building excursions etc. What meager budget they do have is spent on very low to no cost rewards (like a 20.00 gift card for achieving some random goal - usually awarded to 1 person out of a hundred or so.) It's pathetic. 

Another example - Experts had to beg to get cases and screen protectors for their work iphones - supplied by the company, these iphones the  customers actually have to use when signing off on an order. In some cases, iphones screens where broken and presented a cutting hazard if you slid your finger across the screen. After begging management for cases and screen protectors, Experts where finally given them only after attending a mandatory learning session with Body Gardz (maker of cases and screens) reps who talked up their products for several hours and provided free cases and screen protectors several weeks later. They actually did not send enough for all the experts.

But, in general, for what it is - reinventing the retail experience in the home - Enjoy is actually a pretty good place to work. Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, they rely a lot on managers who have traditional retail experience (like from Apple Store or AT&T stores) and the attitude toward the Experts can be a bit condescending and patronizing. There is a lot of child like incentives to encourage better performance from Experts - like your Captain will bake you a big cookie if you sell the most whatever - or you get a 20.00 gift card if voted best Expert at keeping your vehicle clean etc. There's a lot of ""rah-rah"" your great and shout outs, but not a lot of actual rewards, like bonuses and certainly not commission on solutions sold to the customers.

The executives are solid retail veterans - they know what they are doing and the company is poised to be a big success - if this team can't do it - then no team can in my opinion.  The question is - is there really enough of an in home retail market to support this model?  Are technology partners like AT&T and Sonos (plus more coming soon) in it for the long term and do they see real value by lower support costs and lower product returns? Remains to be seen.",4,4,4,4,5,None,https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Reviews/Enjoy-Technology-Reviews-E1090707.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Enjoy-Technology-RVW20689653.htm
